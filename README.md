I just wanted to try out python so I wrote this small `virus` that will lock your folder. To unlock it you will need to run `antivirus`

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
1. Create a conda environment by using `conda create -n virus`
1. Activate the environment by using `conda activate virus`
1. Install the requirements by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the `virus.py` by using `python virus.py`
1. To unlock the folder run `python antivirus.py`

By default the folder that will be locked is `~/Data`. You can add or remove the folder by editing the `dirs_to_lock` list in `virus.py`.

Make sure to also add the folder in `antivirus.py` if you want to unlock it.
